# DIO_ML_P2
Bootcamp DIO Machine Learning - Project 2 
Binarization of Image

* This project is only for educational purposes.
* Even though some prototype of this model was already ready, some adjustments was made with AI support.
* The project was tested with a German Shephard image - the same used in the Project 1 ( Transfer Learning Model) , and the result was positive.

This project takes some colorful image, and firstly transforms this image in shades of gray, and secondly transforms the image to black/white (binarization).
This process otimizes computational resources, eliminating data ( color ) that in this case, and some case specifically ( classification of image) is not necessary for the 
extraction of the main features for the classification.
